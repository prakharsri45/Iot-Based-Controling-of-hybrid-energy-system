The efficient use of the Internet of Things for traditional agriculture. It shows the use of Arduino and ESP8266 based on monitored and controlled smart irrigation systems, which is also cost-effective and simple. It is beneficial for farmers to irrigate their land conveniently by the application of an automatic irrigation system. This smart irrigation system has a pH sensor, water flow sensor, temperature sensor, and soil moisture sensor that measure respectively and based on these sensors Arduino microcontroller drives the servo motor and pump. Arduino received the information and transmit it with the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module wirelessly to the website through the internet. This transmitted information is monitor and control by using IoT. This enables the remote control mechanism through a secure internet web connection to the user. A website has been prepared which presents the actual time values and reference values of various factors needed by crops. Users can control water pumps and sprinklers through the website and keep an eye on the reference values which will help the farmer increase production with quality crops.
