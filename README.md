# Iot-Based-Controling-of-hybrid-energy-system

Focused on controlling of hybrid energy system using IOT. There is various combination of energy and all of them are alternative to each other like solar energy, wind energy, bio fuel, fuel cell, etc. But the need of controlling of hybrid energy system arises when it is installed for domestic or commercial purpose. At this point IOT plays an important role in controlling system. The main criteria being switching between the two sources of energy i.e. solar and wind energy without any inconvenience through a website using ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The data is transmitted wirelessly through website to ESP8266 module which controls the sources of energy. The transmitted data is controlled remotely using IOT. This enables user to have flexible control mechanism remotely through a secured internet web connection. This system helps the user to control the sources of energy, manually and remotely using smart phone or personal computer. This system is very efficient, cheaper and flexible in operation.
